# Project Overview

This repository contains three main folders, each dedicated to a specific area of study:

## 1. Deep Learning with Python and PyTorch
In the Deep Learning folder, you'll find various neural network models implemented using Python and PyTorch. This includes:
- Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
- Convolutional Network (ConvNet)
- Residual Network (ResNet)

## 2. Estimation Using Metropolis Hastings in MATLAB
This part focuses on the implementation of the Metropolis Hastings algorithm in MATLAB. This is an example of a statistical estimation technique.

## 3. Simple Pendulum Simulation in MATLAB
This folder includes a simulation of a simple pendulum using MATLAB. Different numerical methods are employed:
- Euler Method
- Runge-Kutta Second Order (RK2)
- Runge-Kutta Fourth Order (RK4)

*Note:* A detailed report of the simple pendulum implementation is available in French for those who wish to delve deeper into my work.
